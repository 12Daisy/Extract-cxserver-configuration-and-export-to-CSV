# Extract-cxserver-configuration-and-export-to-CSV
This repository is my submission for task #T331201, in which we were supposed to write a parser for a set of YAML files under "config/" in the cxserver repository that determine which languages are supported by the service, create a single flat, in-memory structure with all of the supported pairs, and export this data as a CSV of all pairs. My Python code parses the YAML files in the cxserver repository and extracts the necessary information into a list of dictionaries that can be easily exported as a CSV file. If no other engine is specified in the configuration files, the mt-defaults.wikimedia.yaml file sets the default translation engines for each language pair. Because this file does not define the language pairs, it has no effect on the supported translation pairs.
